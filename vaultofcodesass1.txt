1)Variable Name Typo:

CORRECTED CODE:
number_of_apples=5
print(number_Of_apple)


ERROR:
name error
print(number_Of_apple)


CORRECTED CODE:
number_of_apples=5
print(number_Of_apple)


ERROR EXPLANATION:
name error
in first line declare that as number_of_apples after that should be printed as the number_of_apple is it should be considered as name error






2)Accessing List Elements Out of Range:

CORRECTED CODE:
fruits=["apple","banana","cherry"]
print(fruits[3])

ERROR:
index error
print(fruits[3])

CORRECTED CODE:
fruits=["apple","banana","cherry"]
print(fruits[2])

ERROR EXPLANATION:
index error 
from the above code forward index starts from 0 so there are 2 indexes in that code we are trying to access the 3rd index element so we get the error called index error





3)Function Not Behaving as Expected:

CORRECTED CODE:
def find_average(numbers):
sum=0
for number in numbers:
sum+=number
avg=sum/len(numbers)
return average

numbers=[1,2,3,4,5,6]
average=(find_numbers)
print("the average is {average}")

ERROR:
type error
numbers=[1,2,3,4,5,"6"]

CORRECTED CODE:
numbers=[1,2,3,4,5,6]

ERROR EXPLANATION:
from the above code numbers have all in number format but only 6 in string format so this is considered as a type error




4)Incorrect Dictionary Usage:

CORRECTED CODE:
def update_record(records,name,score):
if name in records:
records[name].append(score)
else:
records[name]=score
student_records{"Alice":[88,92],"Bob":[70,85]}
update_record(student_records,"Charlie",91)
update_record(student_records,"Alice",95)
print(student_records)

ERROR:
